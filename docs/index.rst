Welcome to polcurvefit's documentation!
=======================================

The python library polcurvefit allows the user to analyse measured polarization curves and obtain parameters such as the Tafel slopes, exchange current densities and corrosion rates. It implements three techniques: Tafel extrapolation (linear fit), 'activation control fit' and 'mixed activation-diffusion control fit'[van Ede & Angst, 2022]. Here you will find information about the working of the different techniques and how to use the library.
